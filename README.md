The ChaiPurchase project is a blockchain-based application built with the Move programming language on the Diem blockchain. It enables users to purchase chai (tea) securely through a smart contract that manages pricing, inventory, and transactions. The contract automates the buying process, ensuring funds and inventory are available before completing a sale. Each purchase is logged as an event, creating a transparent and traceable record. The project showcases how decentralized, automated systems can facilitate everyday transactions, combining security, transparency, and efficiency in a digital marketplace.
